# Shared Utilities

This folder contains utility functions and helpers that are not specific to any single feature or domain. Use this folder for generic logic such as formatting, error handling, and type guards.

## Example Utilities
- `display.ts`: Formatting helpers for displaying data
- `apiErrorHandler.ts`: Handles API error responses
- `typeGuards.ts`: TypeScript type guard functions
- `holidays.ts`: Utility for working with holidays
- `browserNotifications.ts`: Helpers for browser notification APIs

Organize feature-specific utilities in their respective `src/features/<feature>/` folders.
