# Shared Components

This folder contains reusable UI components that are not specific to any single feature or domain. Use this folder for generic elements like navigation bars, modals, loaders, and toasts that can be used across the app.

## Example Components
- `NavigationBar.tsx`: Main navigation bar for the app
- `Footer.tsx`: App footer
- `Toast.tsx`: Toast notification system
- `LoadingIndicator.tsx`: Spinner/loading indicator
- `ErrorBoundary.tsx`: Error boundary for catching React errors

Organize feature-specific components in their respective `src/features/<feature>/components/` folders.
