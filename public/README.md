# Public Assets

This folder contains static assets that are served directly by the web server. Files placed here are accessible at the root URL of the app (e.g., `/coffee.svg`).

## Purpose
- Store images, icons, and other static files needed by the frontend.
- Place any files here that should be publicly accessible without authentication.

## Example Assets
- `coffee.svg`: Example SVG icon

Add new static assets here as needed for your app's UI.
